        <p>This stovetop crab mac and cheese transports a comforting staple to a delicacy,
             with lump crab meat, sharp white Cheddar cheese, and creamy Boursin, 
            but it is still quick and easy to make.</p>

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound penne pasta</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay®, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 (5.2 ounce) package Garlic & Herbs Soft Spreadable Cheese, such as Boursin®, broken into chunks</li>
            <li>1 dash hot sauce, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 ounces lump crab meat</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                 Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
                 until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain; keep warm.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, add butter and flour to a saucepan over medium heat.
                 As butter melts, whisk flour to create a roux. Slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly,
                  and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. When milk comes to a boil, turn off heat. 
                  Add Old Bay seasoning, Cheddar cheese, and Boursin cheese,
                   and whisk until cheeses are melted and sauce is smooth.
                 Season with salt and hot sauce to taste.</li>
            <li>Stir in drained pasta; gently fold in crab meat</li>
            
        </ol>
